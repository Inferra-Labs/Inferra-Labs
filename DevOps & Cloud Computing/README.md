## 🧾 Guidelines

- ✅ Keep all secrets in environment files or secret managers (never commit)  
- ✅ All pipelines must have rollback mechanisms or manual triggers  
- ✅ Use naming conventions: lowercase, hyphen-separated  
- ✅ Each environment (dev/stage/prod) must have isolation  
- ✅ Monitor cloud usage and enforce budgets & alerts

## 🔮 Philosophy

> _"Great code dies without great delivery. Ops isn’t support — it’s strategy."_

- Automate everything you repeat  
- Infrastructure must be resilient by default  
- Logs tell stories — collect and listen  
- Security is part of shipping, not an afterthought
