## 📁 Proposed Folder Structure

software-development/ <br>
├── cli-tools/ <br>
├── backend-engines/ <br>
├── docu-suite/ <br>
├── devtracker/ <br>
├── libs/ <br>
├── tests/ <br>
└── README.md ← you're here <br>


Each subfolder contains a self-contained tool or module with its own documentation.

## 📌 Guidelines

- ✅ Use `.env` for configs, keep secrets out of code  
- ✅ Follow SOLID principles + design patterns wherever applicable  
- ✅ Every script/tool must have CLI flags, docs, and changelogs  
- ✅ Portable builds across Linux, macOS, Windows  
- ✅ Logging and structured error handling are mandatory  
- ✅ Containerization or script-based installation required for each project
