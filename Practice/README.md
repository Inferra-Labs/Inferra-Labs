## 📍 About This Zone

The `Practice/` directory at **The Inferra Labs** serves as our internal sandbox — where raw logic meets fearless experimentation. It is not a project space, it is a **sharpening ground**.

This is where Inferra engineers **train like warriors**, perfect their craft, and explore cutting-edge technologies before anything reaches deployment.
