## 🧠 Overview

The **Cyber Security Department** at **The Inferra Labs** is the guardian of digital trust and resilience.  
We engineer defense systems, perform vulnerability assessments, and build tooling for both red and blue teaming — ensuring security is baked into every layer of technology.

> _“We don't just secure systems. We dissect, defend, and dominate the threatscape.”_

## 🎯 Department Objectives

- Build internal security infrastructure for Inferra platforms  
- Perform real-world simulations through red-teaming exercises  
- Develop custom reconnaissance and penetration testing tools  
- Collaborate with other departments to ensure secure-by-design architecture  
- Provide cyber awareness training and tooling standards

## 📌 Guidelines & Best Practices

- ✅ No credentials or sensitive files must ever be pushed  
- ✅ Scripts should be reviewed, documented & scoped before merging  
- ✅ Use isolated networks or VMs for simulations  
- ✅ Version all reports + sign with contributor info  
- ✅ Pair with AI & Software teams for fullstack security lifecycle  
- ✅ Maintain changelogs and patch audit logs

## 🔮 Philosophy

> _“The best defense is a well-practiced offense.”_

- Think like attackers, secure like engineers  
- Simulate before securing  
- No trust without testing  
- Knowledge is power — document everything
